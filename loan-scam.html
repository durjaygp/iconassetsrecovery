<h2>What are loan scams?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Loan scams are employed by individuals who pose as legitimate persons to trick you and launder money from the victims. Most scammers use it to target newcomers and senior citizens. Digital market has opened up space for everyone in the world. Unfortunately, since the pandemic, con artists are taking advantage of it and stealing funds from victims.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The loan offered under a pretense also leads to the prospect of some activities, leading to different types of loan frauds. These scams also use other company logos and various types of ID numbers, and multiple types of activities to gain the trust of the targets. In simple terms, a loan scam means someone uses your identity to get the loan on behalf of you.</p>
<p><span id="most-common-loan-scam.htmls" class="affr"></span></p>
<h2>Most common loan scams:</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whenever you decide to accept a loan, you mainly focus on the interest rates and the terms and conditions of repayment. Unfortunately, many victims do not realize the importance of the organization’s legitimacy. Scammers often hoax people by taking advantage of people’s money needs. When the company poses as a legal lender and successfully collects the personal details from the victims but fails to provide the loan they have applied for and they use your details for their own purpose. Here are the most common loan scams that scammers use to launder money from the victims.</p>
<h3>Advance-free loan scam:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this Advance fee loan scam, the scammers will contact you and offer you a low-interest loan. And for that, you need to pay an upfront fee. This fee is tagged as an “application fee” or “Processing fee.” Once the scammer finds out that you are interested in this, they will ask for payment through non-traditional payments like an apple gift card or prepaid debit cards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The scammers offer another process if you tell them you can not pay right now. They inform you that they will add the loan amount and then create a fake electronic transfer to your bank so that they can launder the total money in your bank account. Sometimes the legitimate leaders will ask the scammers to add that fee to the loan amount, which makes it easy.</p>
<h3>Phishing scams:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Phishing is an email technique through which scammers access the victim’s personal information like username, password, and bank details. Additionally, scammers use Social engineering to exploit people via manipulation to fool them into providing their social information. In some scenarios, you are asked to open an email and download the attached malware software on your systems.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The email sent by the scammer looks like official mail. In that mail, they use alarming language, like a threat that your account will be blocked if you do not respond to this mail as soon as possible. Once the fraudster gains access to your system, it is easy for them to steal your money or personal details.</p>
<h3>Government imposter scams:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Government imposters call or mail you claiming to represent a federal or state government authority. They say that you need to send money, or otherwise, they will take legal action against you. During the pandemic, government scams had expanded taking advantage of vaccination drives, the cure of Covid-19, and the like.</p>
<h3>Student loan scams:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Student loan scams are usually charged to fill out FAFSA forms or debt relief firms that guarantee loan forgiveness even after the payment fees. Therefore, it would not be surprising that a plethora of scammers is preying on Student loan scams. If you fall for a student loan scam, you must take it seriously because it is a severe financial hardship. In this, you usually receive loan scam calls from the scammer and offer to lower or eliminate the pending student debt to a one-time payment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In that scenario, you could lose your one-time payment and never hear from them again. And in some cases, scammers also ask for personal details from the National student loan service center so you don’t receive any past-due warnings or notices which affect your credit score.</p>
<h3>Personal loan scam:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Personal loans are prevalent due to their effective way of helping the finances. This popularity also attracts scammers to launder money from the victims. Luckily, there are some red flags to identify if the lender is legal or a scam operator. If you determine any of the warning signs in your loan lender, then you could say that it’s a scam:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="fa fa-check"></span> They provide guaranteed approval </li>
<li><span class="fa fa-check"></span> They don’t give any contact information or the address for contact.</li>
    <li><span class="fa fa-check"></span> <span class="linepar"> They don’t require any credit check information.</span></li>
                            <li><span class="fa fa-check"></span> <span class="linepar"> They aren’t registered or licensed with any regulated authority.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span id="how-to-identify-loan-scam.htmls" class="affr"></span></p>
<h2>How to identify loan scams?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here are some ways to identify loan scams.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="fa fa-check"></span> There’s no credit check:<span class="linepar"><br>
A legal lender will verify your credit score so that the lender can estimate whether the borrower can pay the loan or not before approving the loan. It’s undoubtedly a scam if they don’t check the credit.</span></li>
<li><span class="fa fa-check"></span> You are requested to pay an initial fee:<span class="linepar"><br>
When a lender asks you to pay for Insurance, Loan collateral, and other fees through online prepaid debit cards, it’s a scam.</span></li>
<li><span class="fa fa-check"></span> The lender isn’t registered with your state:<span class="linepar"><br>
As per the Financial Trade Commission(FTC), every lender and broker should be registered in the state where they do their business. A legal broker posts a list of conditions on their website. A broker who refuses to provide these details is definitely a scam artist. </span></li>
<li><span class="fa fa-check"></span> You are pushed to act immediately:<span class="linepar"><br>
If a broker asks for your details and pushes you for immediate upfront payment, then it’s a scam. Please get rid of it as soon as you find it.</span></li>
<li><span class="fa fa-check"></span> The website isn’t secured:<span class="linepar"><br>
Always check whether the website starts with https or http. When you enter the home page, check its security; if it does not begin with https, just back off. The scammers use a plethora of tactics to lure you. Even if you don’t hit the submit button, the con artists can get the complete information to scam you. So, be careful.</span></li>
<li><span class="fa fa-check"></span> The scammer doesn’t provide any physical address:<span class="linepar"><br>
Do a quick search on the broker’s official name on google. If it provides any physical address, it is a legal firm. If it doesn’t give any information, then it’s a scam.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span id="how-do-loan-scam.htmls-work" class="affr"></span></p>
<h2>How do Loan scams work?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Loan scams include the victims contacted by the scammer by reclaiming that they have taken loans from the bank and need to repay.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In one AssetsRecovery Recovery investigation case, scammers applied for a loan using the victim’s name. And the funds were directed to the victims’ linked accounts. Then the con artist posed as an individual bank and asked victims to send loan funds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In another scenario, it looked like funds were added to the victim’s account by the scammer. But later, they discovered the funds were from another bank account they owned that the scammers had excess to and sent funds to the current victim’s linked account. Sadly, the victims didn’t realize what was happening with their bank accounts because they disabled the notifications from the bank. And then convince the victims to transfer the loan funds to another account they have access to—this is one way to steal your money.</p>
<p><span id="how-to-avoid-loan-scam.htmls" class="affr"></span></p>
<h2>How to avoid loan scams?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most people are unaware of the Financial system’s work, and some don’t bother learning about factors that affect the approval of a loan, which is the primary transport for con artists. So here are a few suggestions to prevent loan scams.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="fa fa-check"></span> Do not pay for anything while making a deal:<span class="linepar"><br>
The lender asks for the administration fees or upfront fee or some “fee”. They also use these words and phrases to try to get money from you. The sad part is that most individuals do not know what is happening and pay for it. Keep in mind there is no upfront fee you need to pay to the lender. The legal lender approves the loan by calculating something based on your credit score. Based on that, they will provide an appropriate amount. They will not ask anything upfront because it doesn’t make any sense asking money from a borrower. They get their income at the end by the interest paid by the borrower.</span></li>
<li><span class="fa fa-check"></span> Learn about the kind of loan you are looking for:<span class="linepar"><br>
Before approaching a private lender, know what kind of loan you are interested in. This can avoid getting targeted by any tactics they play, and also, be careful that most fraudsters like to take their clients all over the place and confuse them with the loans they receive. Legal or professional lenders can understand what kind of loan you want by looking at your credentials. So, even with your credit card score, they can know what type of loan they can help you with. They usually do this to protect you from outstanding debts. Meanwhile, the scammers sell loans that are unnecessary to you. Often, they try to get a sign from you without knowing the complete details of the loan. So, be careful.</span></li>
<li><span class="fa fa-check"></span> Don’t go for the guaranteed approval offers:<span class="linepar"><br>
Have you ever gone to the lender’s office and got immediate guaranteed approval? Most lenders say that they provide guaranteed offers. But please don’t make the mistake of believing them. The borrower’s approval rate depends on the bank credentials, credit card score, and many other factors.</span></li>
<li><span class="fa fa-check"></span> Pressure to act quickly:<span class="linepar"><br>
Fraudsters usually pressure their victims to act immediately. The scammer can get you to overlook the warning signs by creating a fake sense of urgency. But in any condition, you should not make any financial decisions or should not offer any sensitive information and sign documents under pressure. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span id="what-to-do-if-loan-scam.htmls-have-scam.htmlmed-you" class="affr"></span></p>
<h2>What To Do If Loan Scams have scammed you?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are a victim of a loan scam, it is vital to act quickly. The following steps can help you minimize the problem.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="fa fa-check"></span> Contact the firm involved:<span class="linepar"><br>
If you made payment from a bank account or through a credit card, contact them immediately to stop the payment process and initiate any security process.</span></li>
<li><span class="fa fa-check"></span> File a police report:<span class="linepar"><br>
Visit your local police to learn how to file a case. Make sure to take a copy of the information since you need it later as proof of the happening.</span></li>
<li><span class="fa fa-check"></span> Watch your credit:<span class="linepar"><br>
If your private or financial data is stolen, keep an eye on your credit details. Freeze your credit card once you notice any changes in the credit funds.</span></li>
<li><span class="fa fa-check"></span> Submit a report to FTC:<span class="linepar"><br>
When you report a scam to FTC along with the proof, they start investigating and help you get your money back, but it is not guaranteed. </span></li>
<li><span class="fa fa-check"></span> Report case to AssetsRecovery Recovery:<span class="linepar"><br>
If you feel you are a victim of a loan scam, then directly contact AssetsRecovery Recovery. The experts specially trained in this field will help you get your money back from scammers.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is still no guarantee that you will get your total scammed funds back. You can always approach AssetsRecovery Recovery for further assistance, where the expert team will try their best to get your funds back from the con artists.</p>
<p><span id="how-to-get-your-funds-back-from-loan-scam.htmls" class="affr"></span></p>
<h2>How to get your funds back from Loan Scams?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you find out you’ve been duped, keep your composure and gather all the paperwork and information you have concerning the transaction. If you paid using a bank transfer or credit card, your bank or credit card provider might be able to help you recoup some of your losses. You might also be able to recover your money through criminal restitution if the con artist can be identified and charged with a crime. So rather than attempting to recover your money on your own, take the help of Morgan’s financial recovery.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Use extreme caution when transacting money because online loan fraud is rising as the country uses online transactions more frequently. Clients should exercise extra caution while accepting a loan because loan fraud is increasing as more and more people use credit card transactions. However, you might be able to recover your money if you become a victim of a scam.</p>
